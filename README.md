üõ† Technical Approach
This project demonstrates modern web development practices with:

Next.js App Router: Leveraging React Server Components where possible for better performance, with strategic use of Client Components for interactive elements.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling with dark mode support configured through tailwind.config.js. The responsive design uses Tailwind's mobile-first breakpoints.

State Management: Local state for filters and UI preferences, with proper lifting of state for cross-component communication.

Mock API: Local JSON data file serving as a mock API endpoint, structured to simulate real-world API responses.
